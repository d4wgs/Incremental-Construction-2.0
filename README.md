# Incremental-Construction-2.0

Hello everyone, I am d4wgs.
I am creating what one might call an "Incremental Game," similar to popular ones such as: Cookie Clicker, Swarm Simulator, and AdVenture Capitalist but with my own twist.

This project is made on my own time and is my first real project with HTML/CSS/js.

I hope everyone reading this enjoys the time I put in to bring my own ideas to the gaming industry of 2022.


Incremental Game based on increasing cash balance through purchasing buildings. (Version 2)
